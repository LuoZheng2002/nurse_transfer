Use stratefy=y in train test split to ensure the training and testing sets have the same label distributions.

These methods evaluate each feature independently of others:

Chi-squared test – Categorical targets only

Mutual information (MI) – Captures nonlinear dependency; doesn't assume independence between features, but evaluates each feature independently with the target

ANOVA F-test – Measures linear dependency with the target (for regression or classification)

Correlation coefficient (e.g., Pearson/Spearman) – For continuous features

✅ These methods are completely independent of other features, hence insensitive to covariance.


添加Random forest作为特征选择的方法
保留SMOTE方法，因为我们的dataset的体量不适合更高级的方法
添加TabNet作为候选模型
添加超参数搜索范围的描述，并与最终选择进行比较
添加对特征选择模型的描述和参数选择
